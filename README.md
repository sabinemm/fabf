I have created this page for a potential solar panel company. It showcases a bit of their point of view and basic details. 

## UX

My goal was to create a minimalistic and clean website to showcase the information and contact details. The sky blue color theme was chosen to make it feel airy and better showcase the images of the solar panels and the dark footer to symbolize the Earth.

For potential customers, I wanted to provide a brief overview of the company and their beliefs when it comes to solar power. I wanted to provide minimal information so that potential customer would need to provide their email adress to receive more detailed information. The pricing and contact forms are easily acessible as well as an adress, phone number and a map to their office.

## Technologies
