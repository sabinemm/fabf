# About
Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 
 
I have created this page for a potential solar panel company. It showcases a bit of their point of view and basic details. 

## UX

My goal was to create a minimalistic and clean website to showcase the information and contact details. The sky blue color theme was chosen to make it feel airy and better showcase the background images of the solar panels and the dark footer to symbolize the Earth.

For potential customers, I wanted to provide a brief overview of the company and their beliefs when it comes to solar power. I wanted to provide minimal information so that potential customer would need to provide their email adress to receive more detailed information. The pricing and contact forms are easily acessible as well as an adress, phone number and a map to their office.

## Technologies

1.  HTML
2.  CSS
3.  Bootstrap
4.  JQuery
5.  JavaScript

## Features

The website has four pages: Main page called Index.html, About page, Pricing and Contact page. The index.html page features a smooth scroll option using JQuery for a back to top button. 

### Features Left to Implement

In future I would like to make the forms functional. I would also add more detailed explanations for how the solar energy works and how it is implemented.

## Testing

The site was tested on several browsers (Chrome, Safari) both on Mac OS and Windows. On mobile it has been tested with Safari and Chrome with Iphone X and OnePlus 5T. During testing on mobile, I changed the column widths with Boostrap for "Where do we do it?" section. 

Social media links can be accessed by clicking on Font Awesome icons in the footer. Links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"' and have been tested to ensure their functionality.

The forms cannot be submitted without a valid email adress. 

By clicking on the arrow ^ at the bottom of the page it will take you to the top of the page using JQuery smooth scroll script.

## Deployment

This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named  `index.html`.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting  `git clone https://github.com/sabinemm/fabf`  into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type  `git remote rm origin`  into the terminal.

### Content

All content in the for all pages was written by me but by seeking inspiration for content from many other solar company pages across the World Wide Web.

### Media

Some photos were taken from  [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), and some were taken from Google Images with free use with modification licence. Images were altered using Photoshop to maintain the same theme. Logo created in Photoshop.
